# py-tracer

A super basic ray tracer that I'm implementing in Python for kicks and giggles. Probably
won't work right for a little while.

Not that anyone but me will care.

_**Note**: This doesn't actually present any graphics itself, it merely provides the data to be used
to provide a graphical display of the environment (meaning you'll need to interface this with a
graphics library to display the contents of the scene)._

## Roadmap

- Implement shapes
    - 2D Shapes
        - Squares
        - Circles
    - 3D Shapes:
        - Cubes
        - Spheres
- Color
